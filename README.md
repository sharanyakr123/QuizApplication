# QuizApplication
QuizApp is a simple and dynamic quiz application designed for Android devices.

A technologically cutting-edge quiz app for Android devices is called QuizApp. It makes use of a number of technical features to offer a fun and interactive quiz experience. The QuestionAnswer class's questions, answer options, and correct answers are dynamically loaded as part of the app's main operation. The user interface, which consists of TextViews, Buttons, and a RelativeLayout container, is defined in the XML layout file.

The View.OnClickListener interface is implemented by the MainActivity class to handle button clicks and monitor user input. To retrieve references to UI elements specified in the XML layout, it uses the findViewById function. The class keeps track of variables for the score, index of the active question, and chosen response.

The loadNewQuestion method, which updates the question TextView and answer choice Buttons based on the current question index, allows for dynamic question loading. Upon user selection, the selected response choice button's background colour changes to provide visual feedback.

The finishQuiz method displays an AlertDialog with the user's score and pass status after all questions have been answered. Restarting the quiz and clearing the score and current question index are options available in the AlertDialog.

QuizApp offers a scalable and fun quiz experience with its seamless integration of XML layout design, event management, and dynamic UI updates. It is an attractive option for Android customers looking for an interactive quiz application because of its technical implementation, which guarantees effective data management and an easy-to-use user interface.
